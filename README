A module to sync code from a central "build/dev machine" to a bunch of local development environments. 

It uses unison to sync code across machines and you need unison installed on the mac (client) and your dev machine (server).

Typical setup: 

	1 Build machine where you build and deploy from
	1 mac for actual coding
